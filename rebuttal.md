# General Comments

We sincerely thank all the reviewers for providing constructive comments.

1. We provide a correction for common misunderstandings of the reviewers to clarify our methodology.
**S2P itself is not an RL algorithm.** Rather, it is an image synthesis algorithm for data augmentation. S2P only generates images from states in the extended distribution and the previous image. The synthesized image outputs can be used as additional data during training for any image-based offline RL algorithms.

2. If you don’t mind, please check the Appendix in the supplementary files. Most of the answers are already provided in it.

3. We have uploaded a new version of the manuscript based on reviewers’ comments and minor corrections.
